<h1><u>History</u></h1>
<tr><td> "This district with its Headquarters located at Chinsurah 
town is within the Burdwan Division of the State of West Bengal. So far history goes, 
the name “Hooghly” is derived probably from the ‘HOGLA’, a tall reed, 
which grows in abundance on the riverbanks and in the marshy low lands below them.
 At dawn of history this part of the country was probably included in the territory held by the Suhmas, 
a tribe mentioned in juxtaposition with the Angas, Vangas and Pundras in the Mahabharata and also in the Mahabhashya,
 a grammar dating back to the second century B.C.”
The district of Hooghly derived its name from the town of Hooghly on the west bank of the Hugli River about 40 km north of Kolkata. 
This town was a major river port for trade in India before colonialism.

The district has thousands of years of rich heritage as part of the Bengali kingdom of Bhurshut. 
The first European to reach this area was the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama. In 1536 Portuguese traders obtained 
a permit from Sultan Mahmud Shah to trade in this area. In those days the Hooghly River was the main route for 
transportation and Hooghly served as an excellent trading port.

Within a few decades, the town of Hooghly turned into a major commercial centre and the largest port in Bengal.
 Later in 1579–80 Mughal emperor Akbar gave permission to a Portuguese captain Pedro Tavares to establish a city 
 anywhere in the Bengal province. They chose Hooghly, and it became the first European settlement in Bengal. In 1599
 the Portuguese traders built a convent and a church in Bandel. This is the first Christian church in Bengal known as ‘Bandel Church’ today.

The Portuguese traders started slave trading, robbery and converting natives into Christians by pressure. At one point 
they stopped paying taxes to the Mughal Empire. As a result, Emperor Shah Jahan ordered the then-ruler of Bengal province,
 Qasim Khan Juvayni, to block the city of Hooghly. This led to a war in which the Portuguese were defeated.

<h1><u>Chandannagar</u></h1>
<tr><td><img src="12.jpg" width="250px" height="270px"></td><td><h2>"The Land of the Nawabs and The Lords- the French and the 
British"</h2>Wrapped in the interiors of West Bengal, in the Hooghly District, is the small yet significant town of 
Chandan Nagar. This small town which could have been in place of present day Kolkata, had history gone as planned, has 
the most unique and formidable history in perhaps all of India.
Chandan Nagar was first under the rule of the Nawabs, then the reigns shifted to the French. With the arrival of the 
British, Chandan Nagar changed thrones many times between French and British until finally it merged with the State of
 West Bengal at the time of independence. Owing to a turbulent and colorful history, Chandan Nagar has traces of various
 national and foreign influences. A trip to this small town isn't just relaxing and calming, it's
 like seeing a bit of past in the future.The name Chandernagor is possibly derived from the shape of the bank of the 
 river Hooghly which is bent like a half-moon (in Bengali, Chand means moon and Nagar implies city), so originally it
 was chander nagar. From the river bank, it looked like a moon-shaped necklace (crescent moon). Local tradition holds 
 that the city was once the major hub of the trade of sandalwood (Bengali-chandan). One more possibility for the name 
 is a temple of the goddess 'Chandi'. Earlier, the city was known as Farasdanga or "France dongi" as it was a French 
 colony (Bengali: Faras means French, danga means land). The name Farasdanga appears in Bengali literature.</tr></td>

<h1><u>Imambara</u></h1>
<tr><td>Hooghly Imambara is a Shia Muslim congregation hall and mosque in Hooghly, West Bengal, India.
The construction of the building was started by Muhammad Mohsin in 1841 and completed in 1861.The building is a
two storied structure, with a tall clock tower over the entrance gate.The mosque has intricate designs and texts 
from Quran engraved on the wall. The interior of the mosque is decorated with marbles, candles and hanging lanterns.
Hooghly Imambara is famous for its vaunted clock. It is at the middle of the twin towers constructed on the doorway 
of the main entrance. Each tower, having a height of approximately 150 ft., takes 152 steps to reach its top. The clock
 has two dials with three bells having weight 80 mds, 40 mds and 30 mds. Smaller bells ring at an interval of 15 minutes 
 and bigger bell rings to signify one hour. The clock requires two people to wind it for half an hour of each week, with
 a key weighing 20 kg. It was bought for Rs. 11,721 (in 1852) by Syed Keramat Ali from the manufacturer: M/s Black & 
 Hurray Co., Big Ben, London.It is in Hooghly District. People coming from Kolkata have to take a train (Local or
 Express) to Naihati Junction. From Naihati, they have to catch the Bandel Local train and they get off at Hooghly 
 Ghat Station. From there, Imambara is in a walking distance. There are rickshaws and autos to ferry visitors to the 
 Imambara from the station. Or, the best way to come possibly is to go to Howrah Station and avail the straight trains 
 (local EMUs) to Bandel, which are more frequent and less crowded. One needs to get down at Hooghly Station, and take
 autos/totos/rickshaws to the Imambara. Visitors should carry their own lunch/snacks, since there are no eateries around the 
 Imambara. Visitors are also advised to carry potable/drinking water.</td><td>

<h1><u>Bandel Church</u></h1>
<tr><td><img src="23.jpg" width="250px" height="270px"></td><td><h2>Basilica of the Holy Rosary, Bandel</h2>The
 Basilica of the Holy Rosary (commonly known as Bandel Church) is one of the oldest Christian churches in
 West Bengal, India. Situated in Bandel, Hooghly district of West Bengal, it stands as a memorial to the Portuguese
 settlement in Bengal. Founded in 1599, it is dedicated to Nossa Senhora do Rosário, Our Lady of the Rosary. It is also
 a parish church, part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.It is one of the most prominent historical 
 churches in West Bengal as well as in India.Around the middle of the 16th century, the Portuguese began using Bandel as a port. During or around 1571, they were given permission by 
 Akbar, the Mughal emperor, to build a town in Hooghly. As they began settling around the area, their priests began to baptise the natives - by 1598, Catholics in Hooghly numbered 
 around five thousand, including natives and mixed races.
In 1579, the Portuguese built a port on the banks of the Hooghly, as well as a fort named Fort Ugolim, and enlisted the
 services of a band of Augustinian Friars, then the largest religious body in Goa. The following year, Captain Pedro 
 Tavares obtained the emperor's full permission to preach the Catholic faith publicly, and erect churches. Thus the
 Bandel Church came to be constructed in 1599.
This first church was burnt down during the sacking of Hooghly by the Moors in 1632. A newer church, constructed by 
Gomez de Soto (also spelt John Comes de Soto), was built over the ruin in 1660. The keystone of the older church can
 still be seen on the eastern gate of the monastery, bearing the date 1599.
On November 25, 1988, Pope John Paul II declared the sanctuary a minor basilica.A ship's mast stands in front of the 
church; it was presented to the church by the captain of a vessel that had encountered a storm in the Bay of Bengal, 
and its rescue was attributed to Mary. The church has three altars, several tombstones, an organ, and a shrine to Mary.</td></tr>

<h1><u>Tarakeshwar Temple</u></h1>
<tr><td><h2>Taraknath Temple</h2>This is the major temple of Tarakeswar. It should not be confused with Shiva's Tarakeshwara Temple in Karnataka, India.
The Taraknath temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva worshiped as Taraknath, is a major pilgrimage spot in the town of Tarakeswar, West Bengal, India. Built in 1729, the temple is
 an atchala structure of Bengal temple architecture with a 'natmandir' in front. Close by are the shrines of Kali and 
 Lakshmi Narayan. Dudhpukur, a tank to the north of the Shiva temple is believed to fulfil the prayers of those taking a dip in it.
Tarakeshwarnath Takeshwarnath also known as Taraknath or Tarakeshwarnath. He is a violent (Ugra) form of Lord Shiva who
 drank venom (Vish) during Samudra-manthan. Tarakeshwarnath is the husband of Bhagwati Tara. His shivalinga is also 
 situated in Bengal, a few kilometres away from Tarapith. He grants his devotees a good health and life from which 
 anything can be achieved. It is said that those who are true devotees of Tara and Tarak , Bhagwati Tara breastfeeds 
 that devotee and then the devotee attains moksha or salvation.As per local legends, the temple was built by Raja Bharamalla to discover a Linga in the jungles near Tarakeswar. 
 The temple was later built around the swayambhu linga (self-manifested) referred as Baba Taraknath in 1729 AD.
 Pilgrims visit the temple throughout the year, especially on Mondays. But thousands of pilgrims visit Tarakeswar on 
 the occasions of 'Shivaratri' and 'Gajan', the former taking place in Phalgun (Feb-March) while the latter lasts for
 five days ending on the last day of Chaitra (mid-April). The month of Sravana (mid-July to mid-August) is auspicious 
 for Shiva when celebrations are held n each Monday.</td><td><img src="33.jpg" width="250px" height="270px"></td></tr>
